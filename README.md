# Plant-disease-classification
For this project we set out to tackle plant disease classification problem using three models (ResNet18, MobileNetV3, InceptionV3). we train this 3 models from scratch on 3 seperate datsets which are split into train,validation and test. we evaluate the performace of these models on the datasets and then perform transfer learning on 2 of these trained models. Finally using grid search, we perform hyperparemeter tuning one one of the model in an attempt to improve model's accuracy.
